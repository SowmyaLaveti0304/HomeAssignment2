## Assignment Overview  
This assignment is divided into three key parts:

1. Convolution Operations with Different Parameters
2. CNN Feature Extraction with Filters and Pooling
3. Data Preprocessing - Standardization vs. Normalization

## Part 1: Convolution Operations with Different Parameters
### Tasks Completed:
-Defined the given 5*5 input matrix
```plaintext
    [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],
    [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]]
- 3*3 kernel is defined
```plaintext
    [[0, 1, 0],
    [1, -4, 1],
    [0, 1, 0]]
- Convolution operations are performed with below stride and Padding values
Stride = 1, Padding = ‘VALID’
Stride = 1, Padding = ‘SAME’
Stride = 2, Padding = ‘VALID’
Stride = 2, Padding = ‘SAME’
